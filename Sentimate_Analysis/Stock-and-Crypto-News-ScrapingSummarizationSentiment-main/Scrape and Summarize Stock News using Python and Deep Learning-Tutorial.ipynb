We spoke to Rob Khazzam, chief executive officer and co-founder of Float, a Canadian fintech startup. A few years before the infamous GameStop (GME) short squeeze of January 2021 – the one that would be a part of what is known as the meme stock phenomenon – Khazzam saw opportunity with the video game retailer. He had previous success investing in GameStop, first buying shares in the company in 2010 and selling them three years later, tripling his investment. Khazzam bought shares again in 2017. The company was struggling, but still \"generating a decent amount of cash flow,\" Khazzam said. He thought the business was undervalued and viewed it as an opportunity. \"They were trading at a very low multiple of their earnings,\" he told Yahoo Finance Canada in an interview. \"The price seemed so low that it felt like even at a moderate outcome for the company, you could still make a lot of money. I bought it at a time where I didn\\'t anchor to this idea of buying great businesses. I bought an average business, for a phenomenal bargain basement price.\" Khazzam hoped for management to take those undervalued assets and look at selling them. Not long after he bought the shares, it looked like that could happen. GameStop announced a strategic review in 2018 that included discussions with third parties about a potential sale of the company. With $820 million in debt on the balance sheet, an analyst told the Wall Street Journal in 2019 that the best path forward involved reducing debt, closing stores and going private. But that didn\\'t happen. Less than a year after it started the strategic review, GameStop ditched its pursuit of a potential sale, citing \"a lack of available financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer.\" \"Unfortunately, GameStop did not have a management team that was willing to deliver shareholder value, so',\n",
       "  'Stocks rallied on Thursday, looking to recover some losses after the Fed\\'s higher-for-longer stance on interest rates drove markets lower over the past week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising 0.8%. With the question of whether the Fed can nail a \"soft landing\" for the economy still a key debate, a fresh estimate for second quarter GDP came in unchanged at 2.1%. Also, official figures showed jobless claims last week rose slightly from the week prior to 204,000, compared with 215,000 expected. And data from the National Association of Realtors showed pending home sales\\xa0for August plunged 7.1% down from a 0.9% monthly increase in July. The Federal Reserve\\'s message that rates will remain higher for longer has rattled markets, though stocks are showing some resilience after several days of steep losses. In bonds, the rapid rise in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) cooled off slightly, but still remained near 4.6%. Both markets are under pressure from the surge in the price of oil, which hit fresh 2023 highs on Wednesday and is up over 35% since the end of June. That increase is seen as likely to drive up fuel prices, posing a challenge to the Fed\\'s efforts to cool inflation — and in turn to the chances of a rate cut. Oil prices turned lower on Thursday, as West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) fell under $92 a barrel after topping $95 earlier in the morning. Brent crude futures (BZ=F) were lower around $95, having neared $97 in the session. Friday brings the week\\'s data highlight, the reading on PCE inflation, the Fed\\'s preferred gauge. However, some believe it won\\'t be persistent price increases that prompt central bankers to act, but insatiable American shoppers and an economy that stays too hot. In individual stocks, shares of Micron (MU) fell more than 4% after the chipmaker said its first quarter loss would be wider than previously forecast. Stocks ended a choppy day of trading in the Green on Thursday as investors',\n",
       "  \"Stocks finished mixed on Monday, with the Nasdaq leading the way to start a new quarter of trading after US lawmakers averted a government shutdown and as closely watched auto deliveries data rolled in. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) turned just above the flatline at the close, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up roughly 0.7% as Goldman Sachs strategists said valuations in the sector were historically cheap. In a surprise turnabout, Congress on Saturday sealed a last-second deal to sidestep a shutdown that had seemed all but inevitable. That brought some relief to investors concerned by the threat of significant harm to the economy and stock market. But as the agreement brought just a temporary extension to the budgetary wrangling, the relief could be just as short-lived. The major gauges still face other headwinds that helped drag stocks to sharp losses for the quarter and month on Friday, with the Federal Reserve's message that rates will stay higher for longer ringing in investors' ears. Oil prices and Treasury yields (^TNX) are still rising and piling on pressure. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to sit just below 4.7% on Monday, hovering around more-than-15-year highs. Read more: What the Fed rate-hike pause means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards On Monday, the ISM Manufacturing Index for September came in at 49. That was above analyst expectations, but readings below 50 suggest a contraction. Also still hanging over markets is the United Auto Workers strike, which was extended to more Ford and GM plants on Friday. A deal between the UAW and Mack Trucks in their dispute on Sunday could provide reason for optimism. Auto companies report deliveries for the third quarter this week, which should help the market gauge the impact of the strike action. Shares in Tesla (TSLA) reversed an early decline after the EV maker undershot analysts' estimates for deliveries, while rival Rivian's (RIVN) stock was also in focus as its figures beat expectations.

       "  \"GameStop (GME) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 19.4% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier. How to Determine if a Stock is Oversold We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30. Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal. So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound. However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision. Here's Why GME Could Experience a Turnaround The RSI reading of 29.62 for GME is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for GME has increased 30.8%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term. Moreover, GME currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means\",\n",

       "  'ARLINGTON, Texas, Oct. 20, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenway Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: GWTI), (“Greenway”), an advanced gas-to-liquids (“GTL”) and gas-to-hydrogen (“GTH”) technology development company, announces a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) agreement to manufacture and deliver two patented GWTI G-Reformer® units (“G-Reformers®”) to GME Hydro LP (“GME Hydro”) for the purpose of converting natural gas (CH4) to hydrogen (H2) for use in an electrical power generation system. Greenway’s two G-Reformer® units, configured to produce approximately 10,800 Kg of carbon-free hydrogen, to fuel reciprocating generators sufficient to generate 10 Megawatts of electricity. Under the plan outlined in the LOI, GME Hydro will purchase, install, and operate the two G-Reformer® units at its Johnstown, PA facility, where the company has access to on-site pipelines and renewable natural gas. By combining incoming natural gas with 25% renewable natural gas, the project is expected to be eligible for Federal Clean Air Credits. GME Hydro will deploy Greenway’s proprietary technology to achieve its goal of a low-cost, on-site clean hydrogen production solution with no atmospheric carbon, as G-Reformer® units are compatible with processes that separate carbon from its only production bi-product, CO2. The liquified carbon will be sold to provide additional revenue and offset operating costs. In conjunction with the execution of the LOI, GME Hydro has elected to make an investment in GWTI through the purchase of restricted stock. In a statement, Ray Wright, co-founder and chairman of the board of Greenway, said, “Greenway Technologies has been working closely with the University of Texas at Arlington to develop and patent processes and procedures to perfect innovative and clean gas-to-hydrogen solutions. Hydrogen shows great promise as a fuel but adoption has been limited due to the high price of transportation, whether it be by truck, rail, or limited pipeline infrastructure. Since natural gas is abundantly available at numerous locations, the winning hydrogen solution had to be one that could perform the hydrogen creation at the final use site without carbon generation into the atmosphere. Existing hydrogen-creation processes are either non-scalable, carbon-generating, or too expensive to be practical. With our technology, each full-sized G-Reformer® can be transported'],\n",

For the third quarter, Tesla reported top-line revenue of $23.4 billion, missing analysts\\' estimates of $24.06 billion; however, revenue did climb 13% from a year ago. From a profitability standpoint, Tesla reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.66 versus $0.74 expected and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion versus $2.56 billion expected. The drop in profitability could be attributed to expected downward pressure on margins since Tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late last year. Tesla reported a Q3 gross margin of 17.9%, slightly missing Wall Street estimates of 18.0%. Last quarter Tesla reported a gross margin of 18.2%. \"The quarter itself delivered auto [gross margin] (ex credits) of 16.3% vs. the Street at 17.6% with margins that should stabilize over the coming quarters however Tesla is not committing to the end of price cuts and that is a big problem and overhang for the stock in the near-term,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note published Thursday morning. Wedbush lowered its Tesla price target to $310 from $350 following Q3 earnings. Looking ahead to future products, Tesla revealed Cybertruck deliveries remain on track for later this year, with deliveries beginning on Nov. 30. On the conference call, Musk said it would take a year to 18 months before the Cybertruck would be cash-flow positive and that by 2025 he expected a production run rate of 250,000 units a year. Musk added that Tesla would face \"enormous challenges\" in reaching volume production of the Cybertruck. \"We believe the 3Q report will add to near-to-intermediate term investor concerns given company commentary that the current macro backdrop/higher rates could gate its growth (including how quickly it ramps factories), and comments that the initial Cybertruck ramp could be slow,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note to investors.

Days after reporting earnings that landed below Wall Street\\'s expectations, the EV maker disclosed that its automated driving systems are under deepening federal scrutiny. In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said it had received requests from the Justice Department that included subpoenas asking it to turn over documents relating to its autopilot and full self-driving features. Tesla said it also received requests for information, \"including subpoenas,\" on a wide range of other issues \"regarding certain matters associated with personal benefits, related parties, vehicle range, and personnel decisions.\" In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors were looking into concerns that Tesla’s company funds may have been used to create a glass house commissioned by CEO Elon Musk. The company didn\\'t say in its filing whether the glass house was among the issues under scrutiny by the Justice Department. The Justice Department’s requests for information concerning Tesla’s autopilot and self-driving features were disclosed by the company in January. The new revelation Monday that the agency had used its subpoena power suggests it has launched more serious inquiries. The company didn’t offer additional details on the nature of the subpoena requests, but said \"to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred.\" Reuters and other news organizations have reported that Tesla’s vehicles frequently fail to drive as far on a full charge as the company represents. Last year, Reuters also reported that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Musk’s statements as far back as 2016 concerning Tesla \"self-driving\" features. On its website Tesla specifically states that its vehicles are not self-driving and that features like automatic braking and lane correction are intended for \"fully attentive drivers\" whose hands are on the wheel at all times.

Inflation data out last week showed cooling price increases under the surface. The data left markets optimistic on a rate pause in November as Fed officials expressed that higher yields could provide necessary monetary tightening and effectively take the place of another interest rate hike. But combined with a hot September jobs report, there isn\\'t a broad consensus that the Fed is done hiking altogether. \"Continued strength in the labor market could lead to persistence in wage growth and forestall declines in consumption growth, which would leave price pressures elevated and growth above trend,\" Oxford Economics\\' team of economists wrote in a research note on Thursday. \"With the Fed committed to returning inflation back to its long-run target of 2%, this would raise the odds of rate increases this year, extend the duration of restrictive monetary policy, and increase the chances of a recession occurring down the road.\" The impact of the Federal Reserve\\'s interest rate hikes on corporate America are expected to once again be a key focus during third quarters earnings season.

Following the release of its year-to-date Q3 financial results, Porsche warned that inflation and the effect of high rates were a concern. \"Governments increased interest rates heavily ... that creates a situation where customers are quite reluctant [to invest in] a new product,\" Porsche CFO Lutz Meschke said in a call with reporters. Prior to Porsche\\'s warning, Tesla CEO Elon Musk railed against the effect of high rates during the EV maker’s Q3 earnings conference call last week. “If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it\\'s that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply can\\'t afford it,” Musk said, repeating multiple times that higher rates, including high credit card rates, were a big concern. “There’s going to be a broken record on the interest front. It\\'s just the interest rates have to come down. Like if interest rates keep rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability,” Musk added. Porsche also warned about a region that is of high concern to Tesla: China. “In 2024, we expect a challenging year due to the geopolitical situation and the economy in China,” Porsche’s Meschke said. Meschke also had warnings for the larger luxury sector. \"It is also hitting the luxury industry — you can follow it when it comes to share price development of all luxury retailers worldwide,\" he said, alluding to the share prices of luxury brands like LVMH, Richemont, and Kering.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Strongly correlated to the recent dip in Tesla’s stock is that Q3 earnings fell -37% from EPS of $1.05 in the prior-year quarter. This was indicative of price cuts in the company’s EV lineup as Tesla has planned to prioritize affordability amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, Q3 sales did rise 9% from a year ago with deliveries of 435,059 vehicles soaring 26% YoY despite missing Zacks estimates by roughly -1%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Growth & Valuation Tesla still expects to deliver 1.28 million vehicles this year and according to Zacks estimates earnings are now forecasted to dip -18% in fiscal 2023 at $3.34 a share but rebound and soar 31% in FY24 to $4.37 per share. Being the clear-cut leader and innovator in its space, it’s important to note that TSLA trades at 63.5X forward earnings after last week’s selloff which is well below its extreme highs over the last five years and a 26% discount to the median of 86.3X.

       "  'By Bansari Mayur Kamdar (Reuters) - Investors piled into a leveraged exchange traded fund that bet on upside in Tesla\\'s shares as the company\\'s stock price sank following a weaker-than-expected earnings report. The Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares ETF, the largest single-stock ETF for bullish bets on Tesla\\'s shares, saw net daily inflows of $24.9 million on Thursday, according to Lipper data. The inflows came as the $833 million fund - which seeks to track 150% of Tesla\\'s daily stock price performance - fell 14% on Thursday, while Tesla\\'s shares fell 9.3% to a two-month low the day after CEO Elon Musk warned that high interest rates could sap demand for electric vehicles. The fund\\'s shares were down 4% on Friday. \"Tesla has its fair share of bulls – and bears – so guessing the bulls are attempting to view this earnings release as a speed bump and using any weakness here to add exposure to positions,\" said Todd Sohn, ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities. The leveraged Direxion fund has seen net inflows of $501 million so far this year and has doubled in price year-to-date. Tesla\\'s shares are up 72.3% this year. Tesla was also the most-bought stock among retail traders on Thursday, with net buys of $159.5 million, according to data from Vanda Research. On the other side, two ETFs bearish on Tesla, the $58 million Direxion Daily TSLA Bear 1X Shares ETF and the $109.6 million AXS TSLA Bear Daily ETF, saw net outflows of over $1 million each.

       "  'October hasn’t gone swimmingly for Elon Musk and Tesla. In fact, last week the company charted its worst performance on Wall Street this year. But according to legendary investor Cathie Wood that’s precisely why the company will endure: When faced with tough times, its CEO, Musk, comes back swinging. Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, has remained a backer of EV maker Tesla where other investors have lost faith: The auto manufacturer is still ARK’s biggest holding. Wood justifies her support of Musk on account of his “troubleshooting” abilities, and dismissed fears that the richest man on earth is spreading himself too thin. Musk, who purchased social media platform X—formerly known as Twitter—for $44 billion in October last year, has concerned some Tesla investors who feared his attention has been overly drawn to the site. Wood acknowledged that X was facing challenges, potentially drawing Musk’s focus on occasion, but insisted it was no cause for concern. “Elon is a troubleshooter,” Wood told CNBC’s ETF Edge last week. “The troubles at X are not over yet…These difficult times, though, spur Elon’s creativity. He is a troubleshooter and a brilliant technologist.” The Israel-Hamas war has prompted warnings from advertisers and governments alike, telling social media sites to be vigilant on content moderation and step in to stop the spread of misinformation. But such challenges, Wood said, just push Musk further: “We think that each time [Musk] does face turmoil like this, the intensity of his brain cells takes him to new answers.” Wood’s theory on Musk’s bounce back may be tested sooner rather than later. Just days after Wood doubled down on her support for Tesla, Musk hosted a less-than-buoyant Q3 earnings call, during which he issued warnings about the state of the economy and the costs facing consumers. Tesla closed last week at $211.99 after posting its lowest quarterly earnings per share in two years at 66 cents, a figure that lagged consensus estimates by 10%. The update spooked Wall Street—by 10:45 a.m. on Oct. 20, a little over one trading day after Tesla announced earnings, the stock was hovering around',\n",

Since that time, however, it’s been a rollercoaster ride. As things stand, the share price is nearly 50% off its all-time high. Should I be regarding this as a wonderful chance to finally load up? From the outset, it’s important to put this drop in context. While no doubt frustrating for loyal holders, Tesla is still far above the 52-week low set in January of just over $100. That followed a period in which many in the market jettisoned anything vaguely tech-related from their portfolios. Galloping interest rates, supply chain issues and ongoing conflict in Ukraine were among the catalysts. Since then, the stock has bounced, partly due to the frenzy of excitement surrounding AI. That said, the performance over October so far has been poor, largely due to last week’s disappointing Q3 earnings announcement. Revenue came in 3% lower than expected. The number of vehicles being delivered (a little over 435,000) was also below that forecast and 6% down on Q2. As experienced Fools know, this is the problem with any company that trades on a high valuation — there’s always the prospect of any profits being quickly wiped out if the execution is anything but perfect. Of course, talking about past performance only gets us so far. As Foolish investors, we need to be forward-looking — just like the market itself. So, what might get the Tesla share price moving in the right direction again? Well, evidence of a smooth rollout of its new Cybertruck model next month will help. That’s despite Elon Musk already warning that it might take a year-and-a-half before this vehicle is a “significant positive cashflow contributor“. I also reckon further progress in the company’s clean energy division (which includes both storage and solar) may provide a boost. After all, revenue growth here has been higher than\",\n",

He said Musk blamed the EV maker\\'s struggles on economic factors instead of \"coming up with a plan.\" Tesla\\'s third-quarter results\\xa0fell short of analysts\\' expectations. It\\'s now clear that Tesla\\'s third-quarter earnings call on Wednesday didn\\'t exactly go as expected. CEO Elon Musk acted like \"a little baby,\" financial analyst and YouTuber Kevin Paffrath recently told Yahoo Finance. He also described the call as \"terrible\" and said Musk was \"almost in tears\" at one point. \"For a leader to cry about the economy rather than funneling that and coming up with a plan is pathetic,\" said Paffrath, who has almost 1.9 million subscribers on his Meet Kevin YouTube channel,\\xa0and owns Tesla stock. Paffrath pointed to Musk\\'s comments on Tesla\\'s gigafactory in Mexico as an example. The $10 billion endeavor, which Musk confirmed during a meeting with investors in March, would be the company\\'s sixth and most expensive factory to date.Musk suggested at one point on the call that he was delaying the factory in light of rising interest rates, which make borrowing more expensive. \"If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it\\'s that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply can\\'t afford it,\" Musk said, pointing to the impact on monthly car loan payments. But Paffrath slammed Musk\\'s response, saying the Tesla CEO was \"afraid,\" and suggested that Musk should negotiate a better deal with the Mexican government or potentially \"advertise to higher-income areas.\" Paffrath has previously called on Tesla to promote its products to non-fans. \"We need to know the light is at the end of the tunnel rather than hearing a complaining CEO who\\'s not actually providing that path,\" he told Yahoo Finance. Tesla reported weaker than expected third quarter results, with both earnings per share and revenue of $23.35 billion falling short of analysts\\' estimates.

       "  'Navigating the Recent Market Shifts Victoria, Seychelles --News Direct-- Bitget Introduction The crypto markets are buzzing with activity, fueled by a recent BTC price rally. What catalysts lie behind this surge? Does this signal the end of the often-talked-about \\'Crypto Winter\\'? And importantly, what does it mean for investors? Mention \\'Crypto Winter\\' and the imagery evokes visions of dwindling cryptocurrency values and fading investor enthusiasm, much akin to the stock market\\'s bearish phase. Yet, history suggests that while crypto winters are characterized by starck price drops, the savvy investor who remains attuned to market nuances may discover opportunities even in such frosty phases. Unraveling the Shift: Deciphering Recent Crypto Moves Within the last 48 hours, Bitcoin\\'s value has surged by an impressive 12%, not only breaching the crucial $32k threshold but also scaling up to $35k at its highest peak. This momentum breaks away from a year of stagnation, hinting at the possibility of crypto winter\\'s wane. And while Bitcoin remains the bellwether, its rally resonates across the altcoin spectrum, reaffirming Bitcoin\\'s overarching influence. The sudden market surge is driven by the news that \"BlackRock may start preparing seed funding for Bitcoin spot ETF this month. BlackRock\\'s Bitcoin spot ETF has already been listed with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), marking a crucial step in the listing of Bitcoin spot ETFs.\" Spot Bitcoin ETFs are highly significant because they reduce investment costs, increase liquidity, enhance price tracking efficiency, and meet stricter regulatory requirements. They expand the accessibility and acceptance of Bitcoin, particularly for retail and institutional investors, providing a more convenient and direct investment channel. The influx of significant new capital into the cryptocurrency market is expected to boost the total market capitalization of the crypto world. In this context, both institutional and retail investors have gained tremendous confidence. Bitcoin (BTC): Charting the Journey of the Crypto Titan Bitcoin\\'s trajectory mirrors a rollercoaster. A multitude of factors converge to influence its price: Growing institutional investments. Positive regulatory developments globally. Advancements in blockchain technology and scalability.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- A federal appeals court formalized a victory for Grayscale Investments LLC in its bid to create an exchange-traded fund based on Bitcoin over the objection of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Most Read from Bloomberg An Oil Giant Quietly Ditched the World’s Biggest Carbon Capture Plant China Repeats Its View That Israel Must Protect Civilians Hostages and Hezbollah Force Israel to Rethink Gaza Ground War Israel Latest: Biden, Netanyahu Discuss Hostages, US Deployments Disney Said to Near Multibillion-Dollar Deal With Reliance The move sends the matter back to the SEC. The mandate puts into effect the court’s ruling in August, when it overturned the SEC’s rejection of Grayscale’s proposal to convert its trust into an ETF. Judge Neomi Rao called the SEC’s decision “arbitrary and capricious” because the regulator failed to explain why it approved similar products. The SEC had argued that an ETF based on Bitcoin lacked adequate oversight to detect fraud. “The Grayscale team looks forward to continuing to work constructively with the SEC to convert GBTC to an ETF,” Grayscale spokeswoman Jennifer Rosenthal said in a statement. “GBTC is operationally ready, and we intend to move as expeditiously as possible on behalf of our investors.” Approval of the ETFs is seen as a potential watershed moment by digital-asset advocates, who say broader access will lead to mainstream acceptance of what has been viewed by critics as a lightly regulated speculative niche. Industry scandals and bankruptcies such as the collapse of the FTX exchange helped to cut the estimated value of the sector by more than half since late 2021 to around $1 trillion. Bitcoin accounts for about half the total. Bitcoin climbed above $31,000 on Monday for the first time since July amid expectations the mandate will help clear the path for an ETF. The crypto market is closely watching efforts by asset managers to win approval for ETFs. Last week, Bitcoin briefly surged 10%, the highest price since August, on an erroneous report that BlackRock Inc. had won SEC approval for its long-awaited Bitcoin ETF. The move cooled after the world’s biggest money',\n",
       "  'Al Falak St. Dubai Internet City --News Direct-- Bitcoin Spark The cryptocurrency world has been abuzz with anticipation. The potential approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs could trigger a cascade of demand for cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Spark (BTCS). Bitcoin ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds, have become a hot topic in the crypto space. They offer a regulated pathway for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The primary appeal of a Bitcoin ETF is its ability to democratize investment in the crypto sector. A Bitcoin ETF could unlock an estimated $600 billion in new demand, based on a report by Bernstein analysts. This figure more than doubles the current market cap of Bitcoin, which stands at approximately $550 billion. However, these estimates are speculative, hinging on factors such as market dynamics, company strategies, and regulatory responses. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been notoriously slow in approving Bitcoin ETFs. Their reluctance has been criticized by many in the investment community. However, there have been recent developments that suggest a change may be on the horizon. The SEC has been directed to reassess its denial of Grayscale’s application for a Bitcoin ETF. This could potentially open up the cryptocurrency market to $600 billion in new investments. Major players in the crypto industry, including Coinbase, are actively lobbying for new rules. They aim to garner support among lawmakers for the introduction of new regulations. These developments underscore the fact that the future of crypto regulations is being hotly contested. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF would be a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It could pave the way for more regulated and accessible Bitcoin investing, attracting more capital to the crypto market. The potential approval could also have geopolitical implications, setting a precedent for other countries and accelerating global adoption of cryptocurrencies. One important distinction to make is between Bitcoin Spot ETFs and Bitcoin Futures ETFs. A Spot ETF purchases and holds the underlying assets, while a Futures ETF does not. Spot ETFs are generally more popular than their futures counterparts, as they offer a',\n",

In an Oct. 24 essay titled The Periphery, Hayes attributed U.S. president Joe Biden’s open-ended commitment to supporting Israel’s war effort against Hamas to the recent surge in the crypto markets. “Added to Ukraine’s tab, America’s military budget is set to truly explode,” Hayes said. “This will increase future government borrowing, and the sky's the limit when it comes to the sums of capital a war can waste.” Hayes said institutional investors already moved to sell off bonds and treasury bills in preparation for expanded U.S. military expenditure and will be seeking returns from new asset classes. “If long-term U.S. Treasury bonds offer no safety for investors, then their money will seek out alternatives,” Hayes said. “Gold, and most importantly, Bitcoin, will begin rising on true fears of global wartime inflation.” Hayes’ comments come after BTC surged 19.5% in seven days, with many pundits attributing the move to progress on BlackRock’s application for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) investing spot in Bitcoin. The combined capitalization of digital assets is up 12.6% over the same period. Hayes noted that gold has been rallying since the conflict broke out in Gaza. Gold is up 8.6% since Oct. 4, last changing hands for $1,975 per ounce, according to Market Index. Read the original post on The Defiant\",\n",

Since innovation pays, Borroe Finance is heeding the call by incorporating cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), non-fungible token (NFT), and blockchain to streamline the Web3 fundraising process. As a result, Borroe Finance is crafting a name for itself as one of the top DeFi projects because its peer-to-peer platform enables Web3 participants to get immediate cash needed to fund their projects by using their future incomes as collateral. Specifically, the future earnings are minted as NFTs, making revenue buying and selling easier. As a result, Borroe Finance is changing the odds in Web3 financing because one of its primary objectives is lowering the barrier to entry in this field. These factors are making Borroe Finance a top climber in the crypto space, making it one of the altcoins to watch. >>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<< When it comes to the question of which crypto to buy today for long-term, Bitcoin is always top of mind for investors as the pioneer cryptocurrency. Despite the ups and downs witnessed in the crypto market, Bitcoin usually gets the upper hand based on the keen eye of both retail and institutional investors. For instance, the optimism engulfing the Bitcoin network about the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by leading asset managers, such as Grayscale and BlackRock, is one of the factors triggering a bullish momentum in the ecosystem.

       "  \"The latest investor updates on stocks that are trending on Tuesday The price of Bitcoin has doubled since the start of the year in signs of a resurgence of investor confidence in the cryptocurrency after its value tumbled last year. Bitcoin rose more than 3% today to touch the $34,500 mark. It is up 29% in the past month and up 104% since January, though it remains well down on the $64,400 peak it hit in November 2021. Ethereum has also seen a bounce-back, with its price up 13% in the past month and 49% since the start of the year. A combination of economic and regulatory factors are thought to be behind the lift in investor confidence. Simon Peters, analyst at trading and investment platform eToro, said: “The key driver for this positive price move is the rumoured news around a spot ETF approval last Monday. Although this proved to be 'fake news' it was perhaps a preview or a taster of what is to come should a US based spot bitcoin ETF be approved.” A Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is considered a major boost to the cryptocurrency as it will allow investors who might otherwise be put off from trading speculative digital assets to invest in them via a public stock exchange, expanding Bitcoin’s user base and deepening its liquidity in the process. A number of applications for Bitcoin ETFs, including by investment giant Blackrock, are still awaiting approval. The US securities regulator, had previously rejected similar ETF applications on investor protection grounds. But earlier this week it signalled it would not be appealing a court case which found it was wrong to reject ETF application from crypto company Grayscale. The end of a long run of central bank interest rate rises also appears to be helping push up Bitcoin prices. James Harte, market analyst at Tickmill Group, said: “BTC bulls have also been helped by last week’s comments from Fed chairman Powell. Powell signalled that with yields rising sharply, the Fed might not need to use any further tightening. “While rates are expected to stay at\",\n",

The world’s largest cryptocurrency moved up more than 10% Monday, its biggest increase over a 24-hour period since September 2022. The price reached its highest point in a year and a half. The stocks of digital asset companies also pushed higher. Coinbase (COIN), the largest US crypto exchange, opened 13% higher Tuesday while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rose 12%. Bitcoin mining firms Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) surged more than 13% and 17%, respectively. The rally appeared to be driven partly by speculation that the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to granting approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it. BlackRock (BLK) is among the money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product. Bitcoin backers pointed to the listing of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the website of clearing house Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), while also cheering a suggestion that BlackRock had begun seeding the fund. A spokesman for DTCC said Tuesday evening that its \"standard practice\" for the company to add securities to its list, which includes \"active and potential\" ETFs, in preparation for the launch of a new ETF to the market and that BlackRock\\'s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF was added in August 2023. \"Appearing on the list is simply an indication that an agent bank has requested a DTCC identifier for an ETF fund, and that DTCC may process that transaction at an undetermined date,\" said the DTCC spokesman. It \"is not indicative of an outcome for any outstanding regulatory or other approval processes,\" they added. Speculation about BlackRock also drove prices higher last week when a rumor circulated that the SEC had granted its approval for the spot bitcoin ETF. Prices pulled back when BlackRock denied it. Investors expect the agency will rule on the applications by Jan. 10. There is another factor behind this week’s price swings, according',\n",
