using count vectorizer we create a document term matrix which has a matrix of each column as a work and each cell having the count of words.
the row having the word.

it arranges the words in ascending order. if there are any single words, it does not consider them.

each string corresponds to a document. in the case of a data frame, each row would correspond to a document.


p(A/B)=(p(B/A)*P(A))/p(B)
p(y=yes/sentences) -->    where sentences consist of the words present in the processed sentences
p(y=yes/sentences)=(p(sentences/y=yes)*p(y=yes))/p(sentences))
p(y=yes/sentences)=(p(X1/y=yes)*p(y=yes))/p(X1))*(p(X2/y=yes)*p(y=yes))/p(X2))*(p(X3/y=yes)*p(y=yes))/p(X3))...
                  (p(Xn/y=yes)*p(y=yes))/p(Xn))
